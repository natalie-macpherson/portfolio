All the icons where created to visual show the different features that user would receive if they signed up with Refresh.

While doing research on this topic it was really interesting was to take not of the UI trend that many of these websites used and how these trends should be usse in the design of the website in order to make it more user friendly. Additionally, using the UI trends it was clear how the website should be laid out and how it should design to create easy flow for the user.

designpara: When designing the graphics for the website it needed to reflect a positive and healthy lifestyle. Using greens as the primary colour and then bright energetic colours as accent colours was a great way to reflect this identity. Also, including images of activities, foods and people being empowered refelcted the idea of a healthy lifetyle and all that revolves around that idea.
