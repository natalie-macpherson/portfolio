 				<p itemprop="about">Hey, my name is Natalie May Macpherson and I am a graphic designer. I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada but I am always willing to work with people who do not live in the same city as me.</p>
 				<p>Graphic design is a huge passion of mine. It enables me to be creative and solve problems in an innovative way. I put a lot of commitment into my work and I take great pride in that.</p>

 				<p itemprop="about">I love the process of making stuff. It's so rewarding when you start a project from a crazy idea to something that is well developed and the client and audience really likes it. I love the idea that I can design something which can make somebody's life easier. Overall, I am fascinated with the cognitive behaviour of how people interact with technology.</p>
 				<!--<p>I have loved art from a very young age particularly painting and printmaking. I explored painting and printmaking when I went to the University of Toronto for Art and Art History. I also taught Visual Art and Media Art to High school student for a number of years.</p>-->
