"Design can change the way the people can look or respond to the world around them." *~ Me*

"I love making the stuff, that’s sort of the core of it. I love creating the stuff. It’s so satisfying to get from the beginning to the end, from a shaky nothing idea to something that’s well formed and the audience really likes. It’s like a drug: You keep trying to do it again and again and again. I’ve learned from experience that if you work harder at it, and apply more energy and time to it, and more consistency, you get a better result. It comes from the work." *~ Louis C.K.*

"You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend." *~ Bruce Lee*

##UI/UX Design

UI/UX Design is not just about the elements and principals of design (shape, colour and balance etc...) that we all learn in school. It goes a lot deeper then that. I have come to understand that through design I am able to build a certain amount of trust and reliability in providing the user with the best and easiest experience possible.

Over the past few months I have been asking myself the question of why UI is so important to the world of design. I've talked many people who are actively involved in the world of design and I have come to realize several very important things about UI/UX design.

What really attracts me to UI/UX design is the idea that **I can design something to make somebody's life easier**. With a well structured and well design interface a person can interact with the application or website without having to think about what they are doing and how to do. In other words it becomes intuitive.
