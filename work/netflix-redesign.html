para1: With more people moving away from watching shows on cable TV and instead watching their shows on streaming websites such as Hulu and Netflix, it is increasingly important for interactive designs to accommodate children and not just adults. For many of these services, the designs are more geared to adults. When it comes to a younger audience, it seems like the trend is to use the design created for adults and then apply a skin to make it more kid friendly.

para2: The point of this project is to compare Netflix Kids to other children’s video applications to determine what UI elements work and what does not work. Through the research, design changes and improvements the user flow will be made in order to make the experience for children more memorable and enjoyable.

para3: It was really important to maintain the Netflix Brand but to modify its UI elements in order to meet the needs of a child. With the original design, Netflix Kids used the UI that was design for adults and then placed a skin on top of it to make it more appealing to a younger target audience. This did not work because it did not meet the users’ needs. The old design was not kid friendly and did not allow a child to have a positive experience.

para4: With the redesign, many of the elements now have a 3D look. This encourages children to interact with elements on the screen. Additionally, the colour palette is now more bright and playful. Finally, the addition of a feature that allows children to create a personalized avatar allows further opportunities for a child to interact with the interface.

researchpara: There were many research methods applied to this project. The first task was to define the target audience and a persona. Once the persona was created, a journey map was laid out in order to determine the pain points and features that need to be improved. Then there was a breakdown of the main UI elements for Netflix Kid and other children’s application. Once the analysis was completed, a low fidelity sketch of the user flow was drawn out and then made into a high fidelity prototype.

designpara: One of the biggest changes that needed to be addressed in redesign Netflix Kids was to make the interface more usable and engaging for a younger audience. With the old design of Netflix Kids, things like buttons and imagery did not promote children to interact with the interface in a meaningful way.
