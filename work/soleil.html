para1: Cirque du Soleil is a Canadian entertainment company. It is one of the largest theatrical producers in the world. The company is based in Montreal and was founded in 1984 by two former street performers, Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix. The group has turned the idea of a circus on its ear, blending street entertainment, eccentric costumes, and cabaret. More than 100 million spectators in nearly 300 cities on five continents have seen the shows.

para2: The objective of this project was to create an annual report for Cirque du Soleil. The project will use both English and French. Both of the languages will be given equal space in the layout. A focus was given to colour palette, typography, imagery, format, grid and structure for the publication.

para3: Cirque du Soleil performances are very colourful. Therefore, the design of the annual report reflects the colours that are used on the set and costumes used in their performances. In the end, the body copy uses a very dark blue and pink header. Throughout the layout, the use of bright coloured triangles are used. These triangles are coloured pink, blue, yellow, red and green.

para4: All of the main images used in the report are handmade illustrations based off of images from Cirque du Soleil’s sets and costumes. The rationale behind using handmade illustrations is to reflect the innovative nature of the company and its creative direction. In order to keep the images playful, watercolour effects were used to colour the images. On top of the illustrated imagery, triangles are used to accent the layout in order to make reference to Cirque’s tents and the geometric shapes used in their costumes and sets.

researchpara: The first part of this project was to determine the target audience and to see how past Cirque du Soleil publications met the needs of their audience. It became clear that when designing the annual report that the structure of the document had to be innovative but also clear in communicating the information to potential investors. In order to accommodate both the creative and communication aspect of the report, the design of the document would use a strict grid system that would be broken up with geometric shapes of colour and hand-drawn illustrations of characters from the Cirque du Soleil shows.

designpara: In doing the research and creating a moodboard for the document, certain colours appeared more frequently. Additionally, when researching other layouts, it was interesting to note how shapes and images where used to disrupt the text.
