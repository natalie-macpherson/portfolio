para1: Being able to illustrate a look and feel for a brand is a really important element in design. Additionally, promote your service or program through a website allows you to expand and reach a wider range or potential costumers.
para2: Refresh is a hypothetical company who provides a program to help people live a healthy and balanced lifestyle by calculating calories, recording workouts and  networking with other on their lifestyle journey.
para3: This project incorporated UI/UX and web development elements in order to design and code a full website with all of the steps a user would have to follow to learn and sign up for the service. The website is fully responsive allowing the user to use the program on any device.
para4: The colours and imagery chosen for the website were colours that reflected a positive and active lifestyle. All the icons where created to visual show the different features that user would receive if they signed up with Refresh. These icons also provide a pop of colour which draws the users eye to the many features the program provided.
