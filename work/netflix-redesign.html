para1: Being able to illustrate a look and feel for a brand are really important elements in it's design. Additionally, promoting your service or program through a website allows you to expand your reach to a wider range of potential costumers.
para2: Refresh is an hypothetical online program that helps people set daily calorie budget, to be able to track their food and exercises and to stay motivated to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight in a safe and reliable way.
para3: This project incorporated UI/UX and web development elements in order to design and code a full website with all of the steps a user would have to follow to learn and sign up for the service. The website is fully responsive allowing the user to use the program on any device.
para4: The colours and imagery chosen for the website were colours that reflected a positive and active lifestyle. All the icons where created to visually show the different features that users would receive if they signed up with Refresh. These icons also provide a pop of colour which draws the users eye to the many features the program provided.

researchpara: There has been a massive increase in the number of programs provided to individuals to help track and manage a more healthy lifestyle. Many websites are popping up in order to attract those potential customers. While doing research on this topic it was really interesting to take note of the UI trends that many of these websites used and how these trends should be incorporated in the design of the website to make it more user friendly. Additionally, using the UI trends it was clear how the website should be laid out and how the design should create easy flow for the user.

designpara: When designing the graphics for the website it needed to reflect a positive and healthy lifestyle. Using greens as the primary colour and then bright energetic colours as accent colours was a great way to reflect this identity. Including images of activities, foods and people being empowered reflected the idea of a healthy lifetyle and all that revolves around it.
