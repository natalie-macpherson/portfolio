para1: Imagine going through an airport when it is very busy and you have a flight to catch.  You are extremely stressed out and are concerned that you won’t make the flight. This is a very common experience that individuals experience while traveling. On top of the stress involved in navigating through a congested airport, the fear of losing your passport and ticket is also a major issue people have while travelling.

para2: Gateway is an airport application for Android phones that will allow you to check-in and keep track of your flight information. The application is also a way to keep your ticket and passport in one location. Overall, Gateway saves time and stress while travelling.

para3: Through preliminary research it became clear that the application’s main goal was to reduce the amount of stress travellers would experience while making their way through an airport. As a result, the application flow needed to be simple with a limited number of steps to help navigate the application.

para4: Colour played a large role in the app’s design. The use of colour allowed the traveller to easily identify and navigate through the Gateway app. In addition to the colours used in the design, iconography also played a large role in the design. For each section of the app, an icon was used to ease identification and navigation.

researchpara: The project focused on four research methods. The first method was to determine who the user is by creating a persona. The second method was to sketch out possible screens for the application. Once the first two methods were completed a prototype was created in order to allow user testing. The final method was user testing using the prototype for the Gateway application.

designpara: The main purpose of the application was to help the user navigate an airport and to keep their ticket and passport in one place. Keeping this in mind, the application needed to use large buttons and to be graphic to assist with an easy flow in using the application. A moodboard was created to help guide the design in reaching this goal. The moodboard includes ideas from other travelling applications, colour pallets and imagery to inspire the look and feel of Gateway.
