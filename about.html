 				<p itemprop="about">Hey, my name is Natalie May Macpherson. I am an interactive and web designer, prototyper and researcher with the desire to discover the big picture so I design the small details towards it. I live in Ottawa, Ontario but I have lived in Toronto and London, England.</p>
 				<p>I love deisgn and I love fine art such a panting and print making. Combining the two allows me to be creative and solve problems in an innovative way. I love solving problems because through problem solving you are always in a situation to learn new things and that keeps things interesting. I put a lot of commitment into my work and I take great pride in that and I really hope that I will be able to help you out.</p>

 				<p itemprop="about"> I love the process of researching, designing, creating and building stuff. It's so rewarding when you start a project from a crazy idea to something that is well developed and the client and user really likes it. I love the idea that I can design something which can make somebody's life easier. ALso, I am really fascinated with the cognitive behaviour of how people interact with technology and how we can use this information to make better designs decisions. Anyways, enough about me, how have you been?</p>
 				<!--<p>I have loved art from a very young age particularly painting and printmaking. I explored painting and printmaking when I went to the University of Toronto for Art and Art History. I also taught Visual Art and Media Art to High school student for a number of years.</p>-->
