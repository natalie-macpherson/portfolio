 				<p itemprop="about">Hey, my name is Natalie May Macpherson. I am a web and interactive designer, prototyper and researcher with the desire to discover the big picture so I can design the small details towards it. I live in Ottawa, Ontario but I have lived in Toronto and London, England.</p>
 				<p>I love creating and admiring design and fine art. Combining the two allows me to be creative and solve problems in an innovative way. I love solving problems because you are always in a situation where you are learning new things and that keeps designing interesting. I put a lot of commitment into my work and I take great pride in it and I hope that I will be able to help you out.</p>

 				<p itemprop="about"> I love the process of researching, designing, creating and building stuff. It's so rewarding when you start a project from a crazy idea to something that is well developed and a client and user really likes it. I love ideas where I can design something that can make somebody's life easier. Also, I am really fascinated with the cognitive behaviour of how people interact with technology and how we can use this information to make better designs decisions. Anyways, enough about me, how have you been?</p>
