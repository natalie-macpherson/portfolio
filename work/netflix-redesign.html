para1: With more people moving away from watching shows on cable TV and instead watching their shows from streaming websites such as Hulu and Netflix it in increasingly important for interactive designs to accommodate and design for children and not just for adults. For many of these services the designs are more geared for adults. When it come to the younger audiences it seems like the trend is to use the the design for adults but to apply a skin to make it more kid friendly.
para2: The point of this project is to compare Netflix children video player to other children application in order to see what works and what does not work. Through the research, design changes and user flow will change in order to make the experience for children who are watching Netflix Kids more memorable and enjoyable.
