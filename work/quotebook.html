para1: The point of the project was to design a typographic book based off a chosen subject. In order to solve this an alphabet book theme was created with the sole purpose of appealing to adults.
para2: The project needed to have a handmade element and a typesetting element using only one font family. Additionally, the project required that both elements reflect the chosen theme.
para3: This book was dedicated to the artistic work of Angela Cavalieri. Her work inspired the idea of using linocuts for the initial capitals and title of the book. Her work was also the inspiration behind the theme of the book. Just as Angela does in her work the book uses type and imagery to reflect history by integrating typography into the pieces.
para4: For each letter used a historical figured was picked along with a quote of historical significants that they stated. The accompanying text documents who the historical individual was, the time period in which they lived and why the quote was important in terms of what they did in history.

researchpara: When doing research it was really interesting in gathering quotes from historical figures. Another really interesting aspect was coming up with ways to typographically illustrated these quotes in a way that would reflect each individual and the quote they were known for. When developing the quotes it was decided that it would include a combination of linocuts for the initial capitals and hand-drawn lettering for the quotes.

designpara: When deciding on the look and feel of the book there was two options. The first option was to use colour to help support the meaning of the quote. The second was to use black and white to let the design and artistry of the quote and print shine for themselves. In the end it was decided that black and white was the best approach for the design of the book. Also, another aspect of the book that was being considered was how it would be bound and how the initial capitals were going to look.
