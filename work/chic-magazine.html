With that being said, people are still buying physical magazines the expectation of really well designed layouts with great images is evermore important.
para2: The purpose of this project was to create a layout that was cohesive throughout multiple stories. The magazine had to have a determined target audience and all of the design elements needed accommodate the wants of the audience.

designpara: In order to figure out what direction to take in the design on the magazine layout two moodboards were created. The first option was a moodboard that was more targeted a young working woman who is interested in culture and art. The second option was targeted towards a slightly younger demographic that also interested unique and innovative designs.

para3: The second option for the layout and look and feel of the magazine was choose. It best suited the targeted audience and also provided the customer with a classy looking magazine which addressed topics of culture and art is a elevated matter. Also, in the final design because all of the content is placed on black it was determined that none of the images should bleed but be framed by the black like it was displayed for show in a gallery.
para4: Keeping in mind that the audience that the magazine is being design to target three elements were taken into consideration. Black and white were the main two colour and the only element of colour was through the images that went along with the article. With the Gill Sans as the chosen font it added a flare of fun when juxtaposed against the colours and imagery.
