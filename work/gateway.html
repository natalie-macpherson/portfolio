para1: Having to go through an airport to catch your plane is a major contributing factor to why travelling is very stressful and not very enjoyable. If the airport is busy or if you don’t have a lot of experience travelling the idea of checking into your flight or keeping track of flight times is daunting. Finally, keeping hold of your passport and ticket is nerve-wracking because if you lose it, it will cause major issues.
para2: Gateway is an airport application for Android phones that will allow you to check-in and keep track of your flight information. The application is also a way to keep you your ticket and passport in one location. Overall, Gateway saves time because it reduces how much of it you have to spend in lines and as a result, there is less stress for the user.
para3: This project incorporated material design in order to create an Android application which is both fictional and esthetically pleasing. Through the use of colours and icons the user will be able to intuitively locate and navigate through both the application and the airport without any additional stress.
para4: Colour played a large roll in the design on the app. The use of colour allow the traveller to easily identify and navigate through the Gateway app. In addition to the colours used in the design, iconography also played a large roll in the design. For each section of the app, an icon was used to represent it in order to make the application more user-friendly.

researchpara: Through preliminary research it became clear that the applications main goal was to reduce the amount of stress a traveller would experience while making their way through an airport. As a result, the flow of the application needed to be simple with a limited number of steps to help navigate the application. Through user tested many testers expressed that using this application would help in reducing the stress they would experience while making their way through an airport.

designpara: Keeping in mind that the application needed to be easy to use and provide visuals to help individuals navigate the app. At this point, a moodboard was created to help guide the design in reaching this goal. The moodboard includes ideas from other travelling applications, colour pallets and imagery to inspire the look and feel of Gateway.
