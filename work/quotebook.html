para1: Alphabet books have always been a constant way that children have learned. If you consider it, an alphabet book is just a dictionary for adult. The purpose of this book was to create an alphabet book that would be appealing to adults.
para2: The project need to have a handmade element and a typesetting element using only one font family. Additionally, the project required a theme which both the handmade element and the copy needed to adhere to.
para3: This book was dedicated to the artistic work of Angela Cavalieri. Her work inspired the idea of using linocuts for the initial capitals and title of the book. Her work was also the inspiration behind the theme of the book. Just as Angela does in her work the book uses type and imagery to rewrite history by integrating typography into the pieces.
para4: In creating this quote book linocuts were used for the title of the book and the initial capitals for each letter used. For each letter used a historical figured was picked along with a quote of historical significants that they stated. The accompanying text documents who the historical individual was, the time period in which they lived and why the quote was important in terms of what they did in history.

researchpara: When doing research it was really interesting in gathering quotes from historical figures. Another really interesting aspect was coming up with ways to typographically illustrated these quotes in a way that would reflect each individual and the personality of the quote or what they are known for. When developing the quotes it was decided that it would include a combination of linocuts for the initial capitals and hand-drawn lettering for the quotes.

designpara: When deciding on the look and feel of the book there was two options. The first option was to use colour to help support the meaning of the quote or to use black and white to let the design and artistry of the quote and print to shine for themselves. In the end it was decided that black and white was the best approach for the design of the book. Also, another aspect of the book that was being considered was how it would be bound and how the initial capitals were going to look.
