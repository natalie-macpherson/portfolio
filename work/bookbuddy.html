para1: The Book Buddy was presented at the CapCHI (Computer-Human Interaction in the National Capital of Canada) student showcase.
para2: Book Buddy is en enhanced e-reader that will help students become independent readers. The application is designed to provide accommodations for students who have learning disabilities but it can also be used for helping English Language Learners.
para3: The final application was designed specifically for the iPhone. With that being said, the app could be easily ported for use on a tablet or Android phone in order to reach a wider range of users. Keeping in mind the needs of the user, the primary goal of the design for application was to not distract the user with unnecessary design elements but to keep things simple so they are able to focus on the content itself.
para4: The colours used in the design were a pastel bluish colour, an off white colour to mimic the look of physical paper and a dark brown colour for all the copy. White was not a dominant colour in the design because it would be too distracting and could potentially make reading the text on a device more challenging.

researchpara: For many children in the education system learning is not very easy. It was very important to understand the learning process and the struggles a child may experience while reading a book. Through the research it became very interesting to note how the application was not just a reflection on the cognitive process a child would use to learn but also what they would do to become independent learners.

designpara: The primary goal of the application is to help student become independent readers. As a result, it was very important that the text was the focal point of the application. The design elements needed to be neutral and the type used needed to be functional and easily readable. It was clear that through the research the colours used on the moodboard needed to be secondary to the main colour of the novel itself.
