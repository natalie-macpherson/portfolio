para1: Education is not easy for everybody and technology is one way that teachers are able to engage and support their students. There are many students who face challenges in education and they find it very discouraging when they feel like they are not good enough. Also, teachers are always trying to find ways to help their students become more independent learners and hopefully learn to love learning.
para2: Book Buddy is en enhanced e-reader that will help students become independent readers. The application is designed to provide accommodations for students who have learning disabilities but it can also be used for helping English Language Learners.
para3: The final application was design specifically for the iPhone. With that being said, the app could be easily adapted to be used on a tablet or adroid phone in order to reach a wider range of users. Keeping in mind the needs of the user, the primary goal of the application was to not distract the user with unnecessary design element but to keep things simple so they are able to focus on the content itself.
para4: The colours used in the design were a pastel bluish colour an off white colour to mimic the look of physical paper and a dark brown colour for all the copy. White was not a dominant colour in the design because it would be to distracting and could potentially make reading the text on a device more challenging.

researchpara: For many children in the education system learning is not very easy. It was very important to understand the learning process and the struggles a child may experience while reading a book. Through the development of the persona of Cody it was very interesting to come to the realization that the application was not just the process that a child would take to navigate the application but it was also a process in which they would use the application to become independent learners.

designpara: The primary goal of the application is to help student be independent readers. As a result, it was very important that the text was the focal point of the application. The design elements needed to be neutral and the type used needed to be functional and easily readable. It was clear that through the research that the colours used on the moodboard needed to be secondary to main colour of the novel itself.
