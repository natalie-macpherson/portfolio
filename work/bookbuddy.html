para1: Education is not easy for everybody and technology is one way that teachers are able to engage and support their students. There are many students who face challenges as find it discouraging why they are not successful. Also, Teachers are always trying to find ways in which to help their students become more independent learners.
para2: Book Buddy is enhanced e-reader that will help students become independent readers. The application is designed to provide accommodations for students who have learning disabilities but it can also be used for helping English Language Learners.
para3: The final application was design specifically for the iPhone. With that being said, the app could be modified and used on tablets and the desktop. Keeping in mind the user needs, the primary goal of the application was to not distract the used with unnecessary design element but to keep things simple and have the user focus on the content itself.
para4: The colours used were a pastel bluish colour and an off white colour to mimic the look of physical paper. White was not a dominant colour in the design because it would be to distracting and cause issues with individuals who are learning to read or struggling to read. Most of the UI elements were gathered from the UI kit for apple phones.
