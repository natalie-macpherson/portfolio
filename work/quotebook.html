para1: Alphabet books have always been a constant way that children have learned. If you consider it, an alphabet book is just a dictionary for adult. The purpose of this book was to create an alphabet book that would be appealing to adults.
para2: The project need to have a handmade element and a typesetting element using only one font family. Additionally, the project required a theme which both the handmade element and the copy needed to adhere to.
para3: This book was dedicated to the artistic work of Angela Cavalieri. Her work inspired the idea of using linocuts for the initial capitals and title of the book. Her work was also the inspiration behind the theme of the book. Just as Angela does in her work the book uses type and imagery to rewrite history by integrating typography into the pieces.
para4: In creating this quote book linocuts were used for the title of the book and the initial capitals for each letter used. For each letter used a historical figured was picked along with a quote of historical significants that they stated. The accompanying text documents who the historical individual was, the time period in which they lived and why the quote was important in terms of what they did in history.
