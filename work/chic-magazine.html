para1: Even with the increase of individuals using tablets and smartphones to read their news and entertainment, there is still a demand for printed copies of magazines. With that being said, the expectation of really well designed layouts with great images is more important than ever.
para2: The purpose of this layout was to create a design for a magazine that would be consistent through multiple articles. The magazine also needed to have a defined target audience and all the design choices needed to meet the needs and wants of this group.

researchpara: There were three research methods used in this project. The first two methods were to define a target audience and the second method was to create a person that would fit within the defined target audience. Once an audience was solidified, sketches of possible layouts were done in order to determine which layout would attract the right user.

designpara: There were two options for the design of the magazine. The first option is classier with full spread on black with reverse text.  With this design, all images would not bleed off of the page. With this option, the font had to work well in reverse so Gill Sans Std. was picked.  The second option is younger but it also targets individuals who enjoy fashion and culture. With this option, more colours are used in order to maintain that fun and bright look. Garamond and Helvetica were picked in order to combine a more traditional font with a contemporary font.

para3: In the final design of the magazine the first moodboard was chosen. This moodboard with the layout options, imagery, font choice and colours would attract users that are up to date with fashion and cultural trends. They would not mind paying a few extra dollars to get a well-designed magazine with engaging layouts and articles.

para4: What makes this layout engaging was the use of coloured images against a black page with reverse type. This juxtaposition heightens the magazine making it look elegant and more appealing to a well-cultured individual.
