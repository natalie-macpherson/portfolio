para1: Book Buddy was presented at the CapCHI (Computer-Human Interaction in the National Capital of Canada) student showcase.

para2: Book Buddy is an enhanced e-reader that will help students who have learning disabilities become more independent readers.

para3: The final application was designed specifically for the iPhone. With that being said, the app could be easily ported for use on a tablet or Android phone in order to reach a wider range of users. Keeping in mind the needs of the user, the primary goal of the design for the application was not to distract the user with unnecessary design elements but to keep things simple so they are able to focus on the content itself.

para4: In order to meet the users’ needs, the application colour scheme is muted in order to not distract from the written content. Additionally, Apple’s default font of Helvetica was used because it is a clean and structured font that is very readable. Imagery was also kept at a minimum. In the end, it was determine to use Apple’s default UI elements and to change them with only colour and some additional copy in order to not distract the user from being able to read the text.

researchpara: There were four research methods used in this project. The first three were personas, a user journey map and a storyboard. These methods were used in order to understand the user and their needs. The final research method used was prototyping the application in order to have a physical application to test.

designpara: For a starting point in the design, a moodboard was created in order to get an idea on the application’s look and feel. It was really important to constantly go back to the research in order to make sure all choices would meet the users’ needs.
