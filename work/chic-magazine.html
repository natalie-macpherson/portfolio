para1: Even with the increase of individuals using tablets and smartphones to read their news and entertainment, there is still a demand for printed copies of magazines. With that being said, the expectation of really well designed layouts with great images is more important than ever.
para2: The purpose of this project was to create a layout that was cohesive throughout multiple stories. The magazine had to have a defined target audience and all of the design elements needed to accommodate the wants of said audience.

researchpara: The first part of the project was to determine who the target audience was and then to create a layout and design that would cater to a persona of an individual who would be part of that audience.

designpara: In order to figure out what direction to take for the design of the magazine layout two moodboards were created. The first option was a moodboard that was more targeted towards a young working woman who is interested in culture and art. The second option was targeted towards a slightly younger demographic that was also interested in unique and innovative designs.

para3: The second moodboard for the layout and feel of the magazine was chosen. It best suited the targeted audience and also provided the customer with a classy looking magazine which addressed topics of culture and art in an elevated matter. Also, because all the content is placed on a black background, it was decided that none of the images should bleed but be framed by the black background like it was displayed for show in a gallery.
para4: Keeping in mind of the audience that the magazine is being designed for three elements were taken into consideration. The first element that was considered was that black and white had to be used on all the pages. The second element was that the only colours used in the magazine was through images placed in the layouts. Finally, the last element that was that the font had to be readable in reverse type.
