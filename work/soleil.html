para1: Cirque du Soleil is a Canadian entertainment company. It is one of the largest theatrical producer in the world. The company is based in Montreal and was founded in 1984 by two former street performers, Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix. The group has turned the circus on its ear, blending street entertainment, eccentric costumes, and cabaret. Its shows have been seen by more than 100 million spectators in nearly 300 cities on five continents.
para2: The objective of this project was to create an annual report for Cirque du Soleil. The project will use a multiple language layouts which give both English and French equal air time. A focus will be given to a colour palette, typography, a plan for imagery and an overall format, grid and structure for the publication.
para3: Ciruqe du Soleil performancies are very colourful therefore in the design of the annual report it was important to reflect the colours which are used in the set and costumes used in their performances. In the end the body copy uses a very dark blue and the headers use pink. Throughout the layout the use of bright colour triangles are used. These triangles use pink, blue, yellow, red and green.
para4: All of the imagery used in the report are illustrations based off of images from Cirque du Soliel’s sets and costumes. The rationale behind using handmade illustrations is to reflect the innovated nature of company and its creative direction. In order to keep the images playful watercolour effects to colour the images. On top of the illustrated imagery triangles are used to accent the layout. Triangles are used in order to make reference to cirques tents and the geometic shapes used in the costumes and sets for Cirque du Soeil productions.
