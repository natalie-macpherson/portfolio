para1: Having to go through an airport to catch your plane is a major contributing why travelling is very stressful and unenjoyably. If the airport is busy or if you don’t have a lot of experience travelling the idea of checking into your flight or keeping track of flight times is daunting. Finally, keep hold of your passport and ticket is nerve-wracking because if you it will cause major issues.
para2: Gateway is an airport application for android phones that will allow you to check in and keep track of flights and flight info. The application is also a way to keep you your ticket and passport in one location. Overall Gateway saves time because it reduces the amount of time you have to spend in lines and as a result, there is less stress for the user.
para3: This project incorporated material design in order to create an android application which is both fictional and esthetically pleasing. Through the use of colours and icons the user will be able to intuitively locate and navigate through the application without any additional stress while traveling through airports.
para4: Colour played a large roll in the design on the app. The use of colour allow easy identification and navigation. In addition to colours, iconography also played a large roll in the design of the app. For each section of the app, an icon was use to represent it in order to make the application or user-friendly.
