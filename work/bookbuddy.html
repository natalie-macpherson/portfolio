para1: Education is not easy for everybody and technology is one way that teachers are able to engage and support their students. There are many students who face challenges as find it discouraging why they are not successful. Also, Teachers are always trying to find ways in which to help their students become more independent learners.
para2: Book Buddy is enhanced e-reader that will help students become independent readers. The application is designed to provide accommodations for students who have learning disabilities but it can also be used for helping English Language Learners.
para3: The final application was design specifically for the iPhone. With that being said, the app could be modified and used on tablets and the desktop. Keeping in mind the user needs, the primary goal of the application was to not distract the used with unnecessary design element but to keep things simple and have the user focus on the content itself.
para4: The colours used were a pastel bluish colour and an off white colour to mimic the look of physical paper. White was not a dominant colour in the design because it would be to distracting and cause issues with individuals who are learning to read or struggling to read. Most of the UI elements were gathered from the UI kit for apple phones.

researchpara: For many children in the education system learning is not very easy. It was very important to understand the learning process and the struggles a child may experience while reading a book. Through the development of the persona of Cody it was very interesting to come to the realization that the application was not just the process that child would take to navigate the application but it was also a process in which they would use the application to learn.

designpara: The primary goal of the application is to help student be independent readers. As a result, it was very important that the focal point of the application was the text that the student would read. Design Elements needed to be neutral and the type used need to be functional and easily readable. The colours used on the moodboard secondary to the novel itself.
