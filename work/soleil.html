para1: Cirque du Soleil is a Canadian entertainment company. It is one of the largest theatrical producers in the world. The company is based in Montreal and was founded in 1984 by two former street performers, Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix. The group has turned the idea of a circus on its ear, blending street entertainment, eccentric costumes, and cabaret. Its shows have been seen by more than 100 million spectators in nearly 300 cities on five continents.
para2: The objective of this project was to create an annual report for Cirque du Soleil. The project will used multiple language layouts which give both English and French equal space. A focus was given to colour palette, typography, imagery, format, grid and structure for the publication.
para3: Ciruqe du Soleil performances are very colourful, therefore in the design of the annual report it was important to reflect the colours which are used on the set and costumes used in their performances. In the end the body copy uses a very dark blue and the headers use pink. Throughout the layout the use of bright colour triangles are used. These triangles use pink, blue, yellow, red and green.
para4: All of the imagery used in the report are illustrations based off of images from Cirque du Soliel’s sets and costumes. The rationale behind using handmade illustrations is to reflect the innovative nature of the company and its creative direction. In order to keep the images playful watercolour effects were used to colour the images. On top of the illustrated imagery, triangles are used to accent the layout in order to make reference to Cirques tents and the geometric shapes used in their costumes and sets.

researchpara: The first part of this project was to determine the target audience and to see how past publications that Cirque du Soleil did met the needs of their audience. It became clear that when designing the annual report the structure of the document had to be innovative but also clear in communicating the information to potential investors. In order to accommodate both the creative aspect and communication of the report, the design of the document would use a strict grid system that would be broken up with geometric shapes of colour and hand-drawn illustrations of characters from the Cirque du Soleil shows.

designpara: In doing the research and creating a moodboard for the document certain colours appeared more frequently. Additionally, when researching other layouts, it was interesting to note how shapes and images where used to disrupt the text.
