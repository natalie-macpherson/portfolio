para1: Having to go through an airport to catch your plane is a major contributing why travelling is very stressful and unenjoyably. If the airport is busy or if you don’t have a lot of experience travelling the idea of checking into your flight or keeping track of flight times is daunting. Finally, keep hold of your passport and ticket is nerve-wracking because if you it will cause major issues.
para2: Gateway is an airport application for android phones that will allow you to check in and keep track of flights and flight info. The application is also a way to keep you your ticket and passport in one location. Overall Gateway saves time because it reduces the amount of time you have to spend in lines and as a result, there is less stress for the user.
para3: This project incorporated UI/UX and web development elements in order to design and code a full website with all of the steps a user would have to follow to learn and sign up for the service. The website is fully responsive allowing the user to use the program on any device.
para4: The colours and imagery chosen for the website were colours that reflected a positive and active lifestyle. All the icons where created to visual show the different features that user would receive if they signed up with Refresh. These icons also provide a pop of colour which draws the users eye to the many features the program provided.
