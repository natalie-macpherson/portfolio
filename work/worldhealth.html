para1: The purpose of the project was to create an application either on a mobile device or on a tablet in order to design an interactive product that helps users move towards the United Nations’ 17 Global Goals
para2: WorldHealth is an application that focuses on the United Nations’ goal of Good Health and Well-being. It is designed to primarily assist governments and world health organizations to track and plot confirmed cases of disease on a map. Furthermore, documentation is collected on confirmed cases such as images, reports, news articles etc. that individuals have access to through the application.
para3: As designers, we have the power to change how people respond and react to the world around us. This project took a social issue that was present by the United Nations and through research and development a concept for an application promotes social good was created.
para4: The final design was based on Material Design. Therefore, the font used in the app was Roboto. Green’s role as the primary colour for the app was picked in order to make reference to the colour used in the icon for the UN goal. Blue and orange where accent colours. They were used to draw attention to particular areas on the application. For the logo, the design was infused by the colours on the Global Goal Icon and the idea of plotting medical cases on a map.  This is why the colour green was used for the earth, and orange was used for the icon with the medical cross in the middle.

researchpara: World leaders have committed to 17 Global Goals to achieve 3 extraordinary things in the next 15 years. One of these 17 goals is Good Health and Well-being. From a design perspective, the big question we need to ask ourselves is how the exploding industry of smart phones and other electronic devices help the world around us? In terms of the UN goal of Good Health and Well-being this question is more focused on how can we design technology to support medical professionals.

designpara: Once the flow of the application for solidified, research of competitor’s application was conducted in order to see how they approached the design of their apps. The colour palette was based on Material Design in order to create one that suited the look and feel of WorldHealth app. Last of all, a logo was created to identify the application and what its purpose is.
